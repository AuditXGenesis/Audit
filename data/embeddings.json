Our mission is to provide transparent, tamper-proof and affordable audits for Web3 projects through on-chain verification, Proof-of-Audit attestations and automated reporting. The platform leverages the AUI token as its utility and reward currency. Audits are AI-assisted, reviewed by experts, and anchored on-chain for full transparency.",

AuditX revenues and rewards are paid in AUI or USDT, allowing flexibility for both clients and auditors.
