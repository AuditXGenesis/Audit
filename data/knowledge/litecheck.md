# LiteCheck™ — Instant Audit Scan

## Purpose
Provide **fast, affordable** scanning for new/early tokens and MVPs.

## Checks (Examples)
- Reentrancy, unchecked calls
- Integer overflow/underflow (where relevant)
- Dangerous external calls & delegatecall
- Owner-only & access-control correctness
- Hidden mint/fee traps, blacklist functions
- Upgradeable proxy & initializer issues
- Gas inefficiency patterns

## Output
- Risk score **(1–5)** with rationale
- Top issues with severity tags
- Suggested mitigations
- **Next-step**: escalate to **Full Audit** and PoA

## Escalation Path
- LiteCheck → fixes → Full Audit → **PoA (Green/Amber/Red)**
