# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I request an audit?
Go to **/join** or **/contact**, submit your contract address and repository. Choose **LiteCheck** for quick triage or **Full Audit** for comprehensive coverage.

Both. **USDT or AUI** are accepted for all services. AUI may get **discounts** and **priority queueing**.

## Do you have team tokens?
No. **100% of AUI supply** was sold publicly â€” *no team/dev/advisor allocations*.

## What does a Green PoA mean?
No critical/high risks; mitigations verified for medium/low. Safe to proceed within stated assumptions.

## Can PoA change after release?
Yes. If code updates or incidents occur, PoA may be **updated or revoked**. Always check the **Registry**.

## Is an audit a guarantee?
No. Audits reduce risk but cannot eliminate it. Users must conduct independent diligence.
