# Proof-of-Audit (PoA)

## What is PoA?
A **verifiable, on-chain attestation** that a contract version has been audited to a declared standard and risk posture.

## PoA Lifecycle
1) **Submit** contract address + metadata
2) **Analyze** (AI + human verification)
3) **Report** findings, severities, recommendations
4) **Remediate** fixes by project team, rescan/verify
5) **Attest** final status â†’ **PoA badge** emitted on-chain
6) **Publish** to the **AuditX Registry**

## Badge Levels
- **Green:** No critical/high risks; verified mitigations for medium/low
- **Amber:** Medium/high remain; proceed with caution
- **Red:** Critical present; unsafe
